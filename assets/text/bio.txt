My entire life I’ve made things to help others using music, 
carpentry, hard sciences, and robotics. This background 
means I think outside the box -  seeing solutions others 
don’t. My approach combined with my passion for learning 
new skills and passions for learning and finding creative 
solutions  is what makes web development a professionally 
good fit.
